# Task3 📊 SQL for Data Analysis - Sample Orders Dataset

## 📁 Dataset
- **Name:** `sample_orders_dataset`
- **Source:** Public e-commerce dataset (sourced online)
- **Database Tool Used:** MySQL
- **File:** `sample_orders_dataset.sql`

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate SQL-based data extraction, transformation, and analysis on a structured e-commerce dataset. This includes mastering data manipulation, joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, views, and query optimization.

## 🧩 SQL Concepts & Tasks Performed

### 1️⃣ Basic Queries
- Used `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY` to filter, sort, and group data.
### 2️⃣ Aggregation & Analysis
- Used aggregate functions like  `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()` for business metrics.
### 3️⃣ Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Merged data from multiple tables using joins for richer insights.
### 4️⃣ Subqueries
- Used subqueries to isolate filtered logic or intermediate calculations.
### 5️⃣ Views for Reusability
- Created views to simplify repeated analysis queries.
### 6️⃣ Indexes for Performance Optimization
- Indexed frequently queried columns to improve query speed.

## 📸 Screenshots
Attached in submission: screenshots of each query output executed in MySQL Workbench.

## ✅ Outcome
**Through this project, I learned how to:**

- Manipulate and query structured data using SQL.
- Extract insights using aggregate functions and joins.
- Improve performance with views and indexes.
- Write clean and reusable queries for analytical tasks.

## 📌 Deliverables
